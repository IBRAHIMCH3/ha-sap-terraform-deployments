    Here the solution you were looking for to deploy your SAP workspaces using SLES4SAP in some few clicks!

    This tool will create your SAP infrastructure and provision the machines to have an up and running environment in blink of an eye!

    It just provides a basic set of options that we think are the most used ones.

    For a more advanced customization you will need to get your hands dirty and play with the source project: https://github.com/SUSE/ha-sap-terraform-deployments


    ## Pre-requirements

    In order to use the project the SAP installation software must be available for the installer.
    The software can be downloaded from https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter

    In order to use the software, create a new Storage account in your Azure subscription and upload the downloaded format to a file share.

    **This Storage account has an account name and key. Store them as they are needed in the next steps.** They can be collected from the Azure portal.

    ### SAP HANA

    This software is available in different formats.

    1. HANA platform in `.zip` or multipart `.rar` archive format. HANA platform edition contains all HANA components like HANA Database, Client, Studio, XS Engine etc. The multipart `rar` archive consists of a group of `.exe` and `.rar` files. To use an archive for the installation, it can be uploaded as it is (uploading all the files to the storage) or after extracting the contents with any compression tools (`unrar` for example. Find more information about how to extract in: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0001791258). The extracted HANA platform can be recognized checking the `LABEL.ASC` file in the main folder. It should look like (it can have a different version): `HDB:HANA:2.0:LINUX_X86_64:SAP HANA PLATFORM EDITION 2.0::BD51054084`

        Example: `51053381_part1.exe`, `51053381_part2.rar`, `51053381_part3.rar` and `51053381_part4.rar`

    2. HANA database in `.SAR` format. This archive format consist of only the HANA Database Server component. It contains a particular Patch level or revision of only the database component of HANA platform. To extract this option, the SAP `SAPCAR` utility is mandatory, which must be downloaded from the SAP download center.

        Example: `IMDB_SERVER_2_00_037_05.SAR` and `SAPCAR_1311_80000935.EXE`

    Upload the downloaded files (or the extracted) version to the file share under a new subfolder (`hana` as example). **This folder name is used later in the configuration.**

  next_steps: |
    To destroy the currently created deployment run the following commands in the folder extracted from the downloaded file:

    ```terraform init```

    ```terraform workspace select $used_workspace```

    ```terraform destroy -auto-approve```

    To access the machines the next command can be used:<br>
    ```terraform output # get the addresses```

    ```ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p cloudadmin@{bastion_ip} -i {your_ssh_key} -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" cloudadmin@{hana_ip} -i {your_ssh_key} -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no```
