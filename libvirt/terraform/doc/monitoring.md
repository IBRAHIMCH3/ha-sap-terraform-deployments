# Monitoring deploymenet for SHAP:

The monitoring module will deploy and install all tool necessary to monitor your SHAP stack. (grafana, prometheus).

The monitor module will need an extra VM. The packages are the same from Uyuny/Suse manager so we use the same pkg repository.

The terraform module follow the same conventions as other modules

# Examples:

For an example look at main.tf.example file and `monitoring` module
